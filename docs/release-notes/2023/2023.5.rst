GROMACS 2023.5 release notes
----------------------------

This version was released on TODO, 2024. These release notes
document the changes that have taken place in |Gromacs| since the
previous 2023.4 version, to fix known issues. It also incorporates all
fixes made in version 2022.6 and earlier, which you can find described
in the :ref:`release-notes`.

.. Note to developers!
   Please use """"""" to underline the individual entries for fixed issues in the subfolders,
   otherwise the formatting on the webpage is messed up.
   Also, please use the syntax :issue:`number` to reference issues on GitLab, without
   a space between the colon and number!

Fixes where mdrun could behave incorrectly
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

The Verlet buffer estimate could be wrong with initial coordinates out of the box
"""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""

Due to incorrect periodic boundary treatment in the density estimate for
the Verlet buffer calcalution, the Verlet buffer could be off when many atoms
were outside the rectangular unit cell. In nearly all cases this would lead
to a slightly too large buffer and almost never to a too short buffer.

:issue:`5002`

Correct forces with virtual_sites1
""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""

Virtual sites with a single constructing atom did not have their
force distributed to the constructing atom. This likely did not cause
silent errors, as this completely defeats the purpose of such virtual
sites.

:issue:`4978`

Avoid rounding errors with Parrinello-Rahman coupling of triclinic boxes
""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""

With triclinic boxes and isotropic or diagonal Parrinello-Rahman pressure
coupling, the off-diagonal scaling matrix arguments could be non-zero.
This was harmless, apart from causing an assertion failure when update
was executed on a GPU.

:issue:`4974`

Fixes for ``gmx`` tools
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

Fix grompp crash with atoms far out of the box
""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""

The Verlet buffer tolerance code did not put atoms correctly in the box,
which could lead to illegal memory access in grompp

:issue:`5002`

Fix LJ combination rules mixup in nonbonded-benchmark tool
""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""

The gmx nonbonded-benchmark tool would use geometric LH combination rules instead
of Lortenz-Berthelot and Lortenz-Berthelot instead of no combination rules.

:issue:`4963`

Fixes that affect portability
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

Use RDTIME instead of RDCYCLE on RISC-V
"""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""

Starting with Linux 6.6, the ``rdcycle`` instruction cannot be called from
userland for security reasons, making |Gromacs| fail with ``SIGILL``.
Now it is replaced with ``rdtime``.


:issue:`4967`

Miscellaneous
^^^^^^^^^^^^^

Fix crashes with GPU direct communication for some atypical run configurations
""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""

When GPU direct communication was used in combination with atypical
run conditions (e.g. many thread-MPI tasks on each GPU), crashes could
occur when the tasks became very out of sync. This has now been made
more robust.
